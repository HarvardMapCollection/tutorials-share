_"The way we tend to understand data naturally in the context of the humanities is sort of multifaceted, similarly to how we might think about text, meaning that data are susceptible to the same kinds of human interpretation. I think that is the biggest difference from other disciplinary approaches. Thatâ€™s something we can bring to the table."_

One of the goals of this blog is to help you become better positioned in understanding the networks of research data services happening across the Harvard community. There is a lot of data research happening at Harvard. There are also lot of places to get help. In our GIS support services, we encounter a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds when we are helping researchers with their data. The software, methods, and conceptual approaches to working with data can vary greatly, depending on which school you are coming from.

In this post I'd like to surface some experiences of my colleagues in Harvard's Digital Scholarship Group, which is an interdisciplinary team of faculty and staff advancing facility with digital research methods. We talk with data visualization specialist Jessica Cohen-Tanugi, who herself is coming from a background in physical sciences, but has worked across the board in terms of subject specialties, and is well-positioned to dicuss how different approaches to working with data can impact research outcomes.
