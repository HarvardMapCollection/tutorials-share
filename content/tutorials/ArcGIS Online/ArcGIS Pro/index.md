## On your own computer

If you have a PC and a Harvard Key, you can download and install ArcGIS Pro on your own computer using [these instructions](https://gis.harvard.edu/arcgis-pro) from the Harvard Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA).

If you do not have a PC, consider using the open-source equivalent GIS desktop software, QGIS, which is OS-independent.
- [QGIS download instructions](https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/tutorials/census-data-primer/download-software/)
- QGIS is available on all of the workstations in Lamont 310 ([directions](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Hzb4UFgFNbetQ3xa6)). 


## Do I Need ArcGIS Pro?

Prioritizing gaining competency with core GIS methods over familiarity with any singular software will ensure that your spatial skills are always relevant and transferrable, even as programs deprecate or become obsolete.

Despite being able to accomplish most of the same methods in QGIS as you can with ArcGIS Pro, here are some reasons why you might want to choose ArcGIS Pro:

- Many industries use ArcGIS Pro or the ESRI suite, so gaining familiarity might make you more competitve in your given field
- Maybe you are in a class that is using ArcGIS Pro to teach GIS methodologies
- Maybe you have used ArcGIS Pro before, and want to keep working in that environment
