The Harvard Map Collection collects and preserves GIS data for long-term discovery and reuse in the [Harvard Geospatial Library (HGL)](https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/harvard-geospatial-library). You might like to extend the long-term value of your research by making your data available in a tool like HGL or [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/), or perhaps you'd like some feedback on how you are communicating the GIS components of your project. Maybe this is the first time you are thinking about this topic, and it sounds intriguing to you. No matter where you are in this process, we are here to help.

## Metadata?

You may already have a system for citing the GIS layers you're finding or making. Or maybe it's the very beginning of your project and you want some tips. Ultimately, the usability of your data comes down to the documentation or metadata you're creating. GIS metadata is not super intuitive, so this guide is meant to help with that.

## Examples

Here are some examples of projects where the extra work put into the data, methods, and documentation extends people's ability to engage with the materials.

| GIS project | Data, methods and documentation | 
| --- | --- | 
| <a target="_blank" href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58">Mapping Inequality</a> |<a target="_blank" href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58&text=downloads">Data, methods and documentation </a>|

## On this page, you will find:
- A [list of prompts](https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/resources/researchers-handbook/prompts/) for creating your own GIS metadata
- A <a href="media/FGDC-Metadata-Template.xlsx" download="FGDC-Metadata-Template.xlsx">template</a> for doing so
- Descriptions of the [consultation services](#guided-interview) available through the library

## 3 steps to discovery

It can be helpful to think of packaging up your GIS data in 3 steps.

### Research project

In the research project stage, you are immersed in the work of your project. You are working to capture and encode your data. You are managing many different aspects of the project.


### Metadata

When you are creating metadata, instead of broadly envisioning your project, you are now having to switch modalities to creating detailed documentation that can be difficult to accomplish.

Oscillating between actually working on the project, and carving out time to work on highly technical, but important metadata can be challenging, especially under time constraints.


### Guided interview

One of the services we offer at the Map Collection is a guided interview meant to intermediate between where you are with your project, and where you'd like to be with your data. 

Our guided interviews are meant to liaise between the vast knowledge you have about your project, and the technical, specific ways to capture it so that many people can benefit from and continue building upon your work.

| Action item | What's in it for the library | What's in it for the researcher |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Partner with the library to package and describe your GIS data using methods aligned with open access best practices | Provide better access to data materials because they are well-described and discoverable; Fulfill objectives of supporting GIS needs of researchers | Extend the value of your work by making your methods reproducible; facilitate transparency; Ensure you (and not a publisher) are retaining rights to your data |



## Suggested next steps

1. While our service entails helping you create metadata and you are not required to fill out the <a href="media/FGDC-Metadata-Template.xlsx" download="FGDC-Metadata-Template.xlsx">metadata template</a>, we do recommend familiarizing yourself with the content covered in the metadata template so that you have a sense of what type of information you might think about capturing in your project as youâ€™re working. 


2. [Schedule an interview with us](https://library.harvard.edu/libraries/harvard-map-collection). We will walk through prompts designed to generate high-quality metadata. Even if your goal is not to deposit datasets, it can be helpful to get feedback about how you are thinking about and communicating your data work. If you'd like to preview the prompts ahead of time, they are available from our [documentation guide](https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/resources/researchers-handbook/prompts/).
