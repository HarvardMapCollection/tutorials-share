Make sure you have the `MMQGIS` plugin by going to `Plugins` → `Manage and Install Plugins`.
Search "MMQGIS" and install the plugin.
Open the plugin in the main QGIS menu across the top of the screen and select `Create` → `Create Grid Layers`. 
Under `Geography Type` select `Hexagons`. 
Under `Extent` choose `Layer Extent`.
Change the location of the file output by selecting the button with three dots, and navigating to the place you'd like to store the data output.
Choose `Apply`.
