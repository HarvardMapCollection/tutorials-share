This guide is a result of a 2023 summer project funded by the Harvard Libraries [May Crane Fellowship](https://library.harvard.edu/may-crane-fellowships#about) program.
The goals of this project were twofold:

1. To give undergraduate students an opportunity to apply coursework methods for data cleaning, analysis and visualization to a real-world corpus of data, useful to our library work. 

2. To create a website that helps users of the [Harvard Geospatial Library (HGL)](https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/harvard-geospatial-library) make better sense of what types of data they might find in the portal.


The Harvard Map Collection stewards over 11,000 geospatial datasets. We provided the student fellows, Vivian Nha Nguyen and Dhruv Chugh, with the [metadata records](https://github.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata) for each dataset. They used programmatic approaches, largely leveraging Python, Javascript, and D3, to ask questions of the ways our geospatial data is collected, described, formatted, and displayed for users.
The students, over the course of the summer, identified a number of curious findings, which they have broken up into different pages on this site, arranged by topics or themes found within the data itself. 

Peruse these pages to learn more about the students' work this summer. Some of the pages contain robust explorations of a given theme, others are proofs of concept the students are excited by and think would be worthwhile endeavors to explore in future iterations of the project.
