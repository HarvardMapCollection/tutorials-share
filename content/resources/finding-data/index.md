> ## At a glance
>### Framing key points
> - Developed by a bunch of GIS librarians
> - Our goal is to help you develop your search skills
> - We're here to support this skill-building
> - This handbook will help you decide where you want guidance
> 
>### Low-hanging fruit
> #### Search tips
> - `"site:.gov"`
> - Or specifically search the site, instead of domain, e.g. `"site:usda.gov"`
> - `"open data"`
> - `"shapefile"`
> - `"download"`
> - Thought exercise: who cares about this data?
>
> #### Portals
> - [State clearinghouses](https://pitt.libguides.com/c.php?g=12667&p=2206252)
> - Try other geographies, municipal, county
> #### Spatial resolution 
> - Starting small + scaling up
> - If you scale up, you can filter or geographically clip after
> #### Temporal resolution 
> - Realistic expections -- some useful data isn't updated often
> #### Use visualization tools to point back to source
> - PolicyMap (including [blog](https://www.policymap.com/resources/blog)), SocialExplorer ([blog](https://www.socialexplorer.com/blog/post)), ArcGIS Online
> ### Getting creative
> #### Augmenting data
> ##### Spreadsheets
> - Importing coordinates, geocoding, or join
> #### Creating data
> - Georeffing
> - Making spreadsheet with coordinates
> - Creating vector data with Google MyMaps, geojson.io, or desktop software (QGIS, ArcGIS Pro)
> #### Crowdsourcing -- massage this, general (not-content specific sources for 'getting creative')
> ##### OSM
> - Specific feature types with tags (e.g. restaurants)
> - "Basemap" style (e.g. roads, buildings)
> ##### Wiki
> - 
> ##### GeoNames
> - 
> ##### Natural Earth
