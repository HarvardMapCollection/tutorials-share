Depending on whether you plan to make a static map, or there is some necessary interactive functionality required, the steps towards stying the map may be a bit different. 

To create a rendered static map using QGIS, we recommend exploring the [Points Unknown tutorials](https://pointsunknown.nyc/tutorial_list/), each of which contains beginner-level tips for using QGIS to create maps with a nice design. You can skim these tutorials to glean recommended settings for using the [Print Layout](https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/training_manual/map_composer/map_composer.html) in QGIS. 

Check back to "7. Style the data" for more detailed instructions on styling your census map. Meanwhile, for more in-depth advice or tips for other software environments, please send a request to maps@harvard.edu.
