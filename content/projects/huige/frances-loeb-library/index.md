After communication with many archivists and librarians at Frances Loeb library, I owe special thanks to Librarians Ines Zalduendo and Bruce Boucek for leading me to Box DL 2AQ4, which contains the Vertical Files, often abbreviated "VF" in Harvard Library systems, related to the HUIGE. These are all labeled  "VF NAC 1244" and the folders include:
