In this tutorial, we will:

- Work with point or coordinate data saved in **spatial data** format (`.geoJOSN`)
- Work with point or coordinate data saved in **non-spatial data** format (`.XLSX` or `.CSV`)
- Solidify our understanding of how vector GIS data is structured

## Upload two geoJSONs

## Look at tables, rows & columns
- Click on the data, no attrs

## Highlight point in table and map

## Points lines & polygons
- Examples
- Call back to census data structure
- Three file formats

## Search for subway data

## Upload subways CSV
- We can find points in software
- Look at attributes, reinforce
- We can export into .gpkg
- Screenshot osf
- ^ practice exporting

## Segue
- Eyeball vs analyze
