## Story #1
1. A student needed help finding geospatial data and we made them a step-by-step tutorial.

- Here is [the tutorial](https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/tutorials/data-curation/openstreetmap/) to obtain crowd-sourced OpenStreetMap data developed for the student. 

## Story #2

2. A student was still developing the concept for their mapping project and used their initial Harvard Maps consult to brainstorm and sketch out ideas.
