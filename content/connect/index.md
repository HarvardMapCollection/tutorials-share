## About

This site is an effort of the Harvard Map Collection to make our teaching and research materials more discoverable.

There are many people at Harvard teaching GIS or using GIS in their research. If this is you, we would like to be more connected!

Are you already using GIS @ Harvard? Would you like to start?
