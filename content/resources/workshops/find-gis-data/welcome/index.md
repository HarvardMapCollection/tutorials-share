<h2>Scope</h2>

<p> ðŸš¨ This is not a workshop on how to use GIS mapping software. Please consider referring to our other in-person <a href="https://libcal.library.harvard.edu/calendar/main?t=d&q=gis&cid=15049&cal=15049&inc=0">learning opportunities</a> or <a href = "https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/resources/workshops">follow-along materials</a> from previous events. </p>

<p>ðŸš¨ Today will focus on how to find relevant <em>source data</em> for a GIS project. </p>

</div>

> ## Goals
>
> 1. Understand the value of a few common GIS data approaches.
> 2. Get a feel for the flow and pace of working with GIS data.
> 3. Leave knowing which resources you can rely on for your project.

## What is the benefit of using GIS layers?

### Sample data
You can download and explore sample datasets related to this activity from the workshop data homepage, hosted on the Open Science Framework (OSF.io)
> 1. Visit the [workshop data homepage](https://osf.io/exnyg). 

> 2. Click the three vertical dots icon and select `Download`.
![OSF data download page](../media/download.png)

> 3. The folder that downloads to your computer contains sample data from all the workshop activities. It is a zipped or compressed file. In order to use it, you will have to `double-click` it on Mac or `right-click` â†’ `Extract` or `Uncompress` on a PC. 

> To follow-along in class, or explore the sample data at home, [download QGIS](https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/tutorials/census-data-primer/download-software/), a free tool. Note, if you have a Mac, you will have to `right-click` the green Q desktop icon and select `Open` the first time you use it, since is not available from the App Store.
