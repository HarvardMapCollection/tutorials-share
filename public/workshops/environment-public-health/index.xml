      <description>To start to explore how to access and use geospatial data, we will start with an example data scenario. The map below shows census tracts graded by social vulnerability index, layered against the locations of known toxics release facilities in Massachusetts.&#xA;Map layers displayed in desktop GIS program, QGIS.&#xA;The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is a dataset that garners census variables to identify and rank communities based on their vulnerability to environmental hazards or other emergencies.</description>

      <description>In this activity, we will use the Environmental Justice (EJ) Populations by Census Block Group dataset for the City of Boston to understand how geospatial data is structured.&#xA;The EJ Populations dataset serves as a planning and analytical tool to locate neighborhoods that may face disproportionate environmental burdens or have limited access to environmental benefits due to socioeconomic factors.&#xA;In-class activity Visit the EJ population dataset in the Harvard Geospatial Library (HGL): Environmental Justice Populations by Census Block Group, Boston, Massachusetts, 2020 .</description>

      <description>In this tutorial, we are going to demonstrate how to map both nominal and interval data, using Environmental Justice Population and Tree Cover data as examples.&#xA;Nominal data refers to categories without any inherent numerical relationship. Interval data refers to a numerical scale where the distance between numbers is known and consistent. You can use this understanding to leverage cartographic conventions and software templates designed for each level of measurement.</description>
