## Polish cities data: interactive map view

<iframe title="Interactive map of the Polish cities statistical data. Hovering over each city reveals information about the city." src="https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/classes/gened1140/fall-2022/assignment/demo/polish-cities/" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
<figcaption class="append">Hover over each Polish city to engage with statistics about the city from around the time of WWI. In addition to plebiscite vote results, there is also statistical demographic data from 1911 conveying the percentage of Polish-speaking school children in each city.</figcaption>

## Polish cities data: table view

![A screenshot of the tabular data, each row showing a Polish city, and each column containing statistical information about that city](media/table-poland.png)
*This is what the Polish cities GIS dataset looks like, displayed in tabular view in the GIS software. To interpret what the column headers mean, use the codebook pictured below. The codebook and dataset are both available for download as spreadsheets in `.csv` format. You can open these files in Excel, if you would like to use the data, but don't want to map it. Here is the [data download link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cKUtwbPIaWjvI_a_zD-Su_fItkA9u5UT/view?usp=sharing).*


## Polish cities data codebook


![A screenshot of the data codebook, where one column the table is the dataset field header, and another column is the human readable description of what that column represents. For example, P0001 translates into Percent of Polish-speaking school children.](media/2-13.png)

## Polish cities data source


![A screenshot of the book this dataset was derived from](media/book-table.png)
_The source of this dataset is a table found in `The American Political Science Review`. So long as sources contain some indication of where phenomena occur, such as city names, or coordinates, we can transform the information into GIS data used for map making._ 

## Polish cities data symbolized and compared against nationalities map

![The finished map, showing a base layer of demographic makeup in Poland in 1919, and pie chart symbols for each Polish city, depicting the comparative percentage of votes for Poland versus East Prussia, or Germany, in the Allenstein plebiscite vote. There is also a border around the Allenstein plebiscite region.](media/MAP.png)
*In the GIS tutorial, we learn how to make this map, using the above datasets to compare the percent of plebiscite vote results for East Prussia (Germany) and Poland, respectively. This data is overlaid onto a map from 1919, showing nationality demographics of Poland at the time -- red for Polish, and blue for German.*
