## A remembered yet unknown Institute of Geographical Exploration at Harvard (1930-1951) 

This dataset and story open the past of Harvard University’s *Institute of Geographical Exploration* (HUIGE, 1932-1951). The HUIGE was a building, a branch of Harvard’s defunct Geography department, a home to many students, and still a mystery to this day.

- The scope of this project is simple: making a guide to as many repositories of HUIGE-related artifacts across Harvard’s campus and other institutions across Massachusetts.
- This guide cannot be complete but will hopefully help launch further inquiries into the fate of Aerial Photography and Geography at Harvard and in the USA.
- The hope of this project is to call to action anyone with further knowledge about the HUIGE, its activities, and the evolving role of Aerial Photography between WWI and the evolution of Satellite Imagery in order to complete the gaps hinted at in this story.
- This project was supported by the [Pforzheimer Fellowship](https://library.harvard.edu/grants-fellowships/pforzheimer-fellowships) at Harvard, with a focus on Geospatial Data and Archival Research, and overseen by the Map Collections and especially Belle Lipton.

Every good story starts with a spark and a helping hand to fan it. This one stems from the records and institutional knowledge unveiled by the wonderful people at Havard’s Map Collection. Custodians of many important maps and the personal documents of geographers having worked at Harvard, our Map librarians have kept a finger on the pulse of Geography’s unravelling at Harvard and beyond. Due to their unrestrained support, I was brought in contact in the very beginning of my Pforzheimer Fellowship with four inestimable pillars of the HUIGE’s story:

1. Correspondence between DCR archivist Sean Fischer and the Harvard Forest Archive about the HUIGE-conducted Massachusetts aerial survey of 1933, first State-wide aerial photographic survey in America;
2. Papers recording the transfer of over 100,000 maps and photos to Harvard’s Map Collection upon HUIGE’s closure;
3. A complete photographic survey of Cape Cod taken by the HUIGE, only exemplar of a complete survey taken by the HUIGE in any archival collection to date and to my knowledge;
… all topics I will return to throughout this article, and last but not least, for the nerdy joy of research: 
4. A stamp used at the HUIGE and which now graces my booklet!

### HUIGE

The Institute was founded by Alexander Hamilton Rice through a contract with Harvard’s President Lawrence Lowell on June 18th 1930. According to the agreement between Rice and President Lowell, the former would fund the building of a “School of Geography” (regardless of there already being a Department of Geology and Geography at Harvard) with the “chief aim” of teaching “the fundamentals of geographical science and their application to pure regional geography, particularizing, especially, in geographic and physiographic problems and their relation with complementary ontographic problems”.[^1] From the lofty proposal emerged a project of two decades, hosted in what is now the Yenching Library of Harvard, at 2 Divinity Ave. Upon its final closure, October 30th 1951, the building was vacated and its belongings were distributed across Harvard’s archives, where pockets of information related to the Institute remain unconnected to this day. This article provides a gateway to the currently recorded holdings of HUIGE’s materials by Harvard Libraries and Archives. 

The story of HUIGE is inseparable from that of its founder. Rice was an exploration geographer of the Northwest Amazon and one of the wealthiest socialites of Newport R.I., after marrying the then Eleanor Elkins Widener, famous donor of Widener Library to Harvard. Rice’s mapping trips down the Orinoco and Rio Negro pioneered new techniques for surveying in the 1920s (by airplane and with the help of radio-communication), but only at the cost of indigenous lives. His harmful exploration resulted in many deaths among indigenous peoples encountered. They intrinsically haunt this story, and I hope that their resurfacing in the account below may be a small step in remembrance and further recollection. Rice’s person and personality had become eponymous of the School of Geography itself, as many people in common parlance still refer to the old HUIGE as the “Rice Institute”. Yet the work undergone at HUIGE went beyond the man, even though it was only made possible by his and the new Mrs. Rice’s donations, as well as his selection of personnel for the Institute. This project hopes to expand on the real work done by the HUIGE throughout its two decades of operation.
