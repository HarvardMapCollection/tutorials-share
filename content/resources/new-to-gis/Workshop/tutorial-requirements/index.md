In order to follow this workshop, you will need the free, open-source desktop software QGIS. This tutorial will teach you how to download it and use some of its most useful features. 

There are many software options for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing geospatial data. QGIS is a favorite, as it is free, lightweight, and doesn't require a login or license. 

 The concepts from this course are not software-specific, so you will be able to apply them to whichever software you end up using. Moreover, the fundamentals from this course will be instrumental as you attempt to use other and especially browser-based software, such as ArcGIS StoryMaps.

 ## Downlaoding QGIS

To download QGIS, visit the [QGIS download page](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). Select the `long-term release (most stable)`.

Install the program. 

### Size constraints
