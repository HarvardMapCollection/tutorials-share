In this interview with [Megan Potterbusch](https://library.harvard.edu/staff/megan-potterbusch), the Harvard Kennedy School's Research Data Steward, you will learn:

- How to balance open science and data safety
- How to get started with support for your research

## The interview



<span style="font-family:lorabold;color:#5f0217;">BELLE LIPTON:</span> Megan, can you introduce us to your role?

<span style="font-family:lorabold;color:#5f0217;">MEGAN POTTERBUSCH:</span> I work within the Kennedy School’s Libraries and Research Services. I'm the primary reviewer for data safety plans. A data safety plan is required for anyone who is working with regulated or contracted data, especially data that is considered sensitive. That means if there is a data use agreement, a licensing agreement, special terms of use, or an IRB, there are paths in to the data safety system. I am the primary reviewer for data safeties. It's unusual for a librarian to serve in this capacity because it usually falls under a school security officer or something like that. Here at Harvard, I serve in that role because it’s all about Research Data Management.

<span style="font-family:lorabold;color:#5f0217;">LIPTON:</span> I'm interested in the unique nature of the data that students are working with at the Kennedy School, which would necessitate this sort of librarian safety person. I know before Harvard you were working on projects with the Association for Research Libraries and the Open Science Framework, helping researchers with open access publishing processes, such as reproducibility and long-term preservation.

Do you see data safety and open access publishing principles in tension with one another, and how do you balance helping researchers with both?

<span style="font-family:lorabold;color:#5f0217;">POTTERBUSCH:</span>  I was attending a lecture yesterday about how journals are grappling with this exact question. How can you expect open science and open data knowing that some people who are publishing are working with data that is restricted in some way, and that it can't be fully open? There's some motion happening on this issue in clinical trials and genetic data, but in terms of qualitative data or data that comes from businesses or is internal to governments, there's still no easy answer. You could say "deidentify", OK. But what do you mean? 

To me, we're facilitating open science, the ability to push boundaries and do research we weren't able to do before by setting up these relationships that ensure that we're respecting privacy, confidentiality, intellectual property from the data provider. We're able to move forward with the research. And before, without a mechanism like a data use agreement to facilitate the sharing of that data with special guard rails, we couldn't do some of the research that we're now able to do. There would have to be a lot of informal trust established and by establishing a path for a more formalized trust between institutions we can actually use that data and do research. It's exciting to me because it's facilitating the ability to do research. 

How do we then balance that with open science? It becomes about how do you cite the data, how you describe effectively the data source? If a future person wanted to do research with a dataset that couldn't be shared by any means, would they understand how to request the same data? There is not an easy answer in a lot of cases for how to do that, for instance say you're working with an administrative report generated on a particular day and then maybe staff turnover happened. That's when I like to talk about methods reproducibility instead of results reproducibility. Could someone else follow your methods? So that's how I like to approach it. Even if you can't share the data, there are things you can do to have transparency in your research. 


<span style="font-family:lorabold;color:#5f0217;">LIPTON:</span> 
What do you think makes the library uniquely positioned to help researchers with this set of considerations? Why should people chat with us?


<span style="font-family:lorabold;color:#5f0217;">POTTERBUSCH:</span> Well, we have a long history of working in this space of providing literacy resources. I hear from faculty members that they're grateful to be working with me, because I'm in a position to watch the changes and developments that are happening across multiple fields. If you're looking only inside of your niche, you might be missing breakthroughs and innovations in other fields in the realm of open science.


Another reason is that we have a long history of organizing information as a profession. Research computing might be able to help you build a database, but what if you need to identify and use a controlled vocabulary? What if you need a specific metadata schema to faciliate discovery? If you're spinning your wheels about how to find funding for maintaining a website or database after your grant is finished, how are you going to know the stewardship and maintenance support options that may be available to you?

<span style="font-family:lorabold;color:#5f0217;">LIPTON:</span> Megan, you're sitting in the Harvard Kennedy School Libraries. I've been really enjoying working with you and some of your data-adjacent colleagues such as Alessandra Seiter and James Adams on providing joint geospatial learning opportunities to your communities. It's been awesome nurturing a network of librarians so that we can answer questions robustly. My last question is, if something you've said has resonated with someone who is not part of the Kennedy School, what steps do you recommend for that person?

<span style="font-family:lorabold;color:#5f0217;">POTTERBUSCH:</span> 
If people have questions about libraries, open science, privacy and security, they can absolutely reach out to me as a first stop. I can then help link to the right data services for your school or research question.
