## Objectives

## 10 minutes to get started

> 1. Visit [Atlascope.org](https://www.atlascope.org/), search for a place in Boston or Cambridge you are interested in exploring on a historical map, and experiment with toggling between different georeferenced map layers.

> 2. Visit the [Harvard Geospatial Library (HGL)](https://hgl.harvard.edu/?_gl=1*1y0xlw4*_ga*NTcxOTEzNDcyLjE3MjE4NTI2NzQ.*_ga_3CXC97RWEK*MTcyNDQzNTUyMC4yNy4wLjE3MjQ0MzU1MjAuNjAuMC4w).

> 3. Click the `Search` button.

> 4. In the left-hand side facets, under `Format` choose `GeoTIFF`. Under `Access`, choose `Public`. You can further filter results by the `Institution` which holds the source, the `Place` it depicts, or you can use the `Search Bar` to further refine results. 

> 5. Choose a result, and click `Click to Wake` on the map, to see a preview of the georeferenced image.

> 6. Notice on the page where to download the `.geoTIFF`, so that you could bring the file into your GIS project.

> 7. If you have more time, you can choose to explore: 
> - the [process](https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/resources/workshops/workshop-4/archival-maps/#finding-a-historical-map-to-use) for finding a historic map in the hundreds of thousands of maps in the Harvard Map Collection which have not already been georeferenced.  
> - how to [turn georeferenced maps into digital vector data](https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/tutorials/qgis/adler/), and use that data to perform spatial analysis.
