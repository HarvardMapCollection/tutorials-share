We are pleased to announce that our comprehensive collection of GIS and spatial data guides, tutorials, and project examples has officially migrated to the Harvard Library SpringShare platform. This move is part of our ongoing commitment to enhancing research support and accessibility.

This migration offers several key benefits:

- Our materials will now be more easily discoverable within the Harvard Library ecosystem

- The new platform provides a more user-friendly environment for students, researchers, and staff to contribute learning materials and share updates on GIS and mapping activities within the library.

We look forward to leveraging the new platform to share even more enriching and robust resources on GIS and spatial data.
