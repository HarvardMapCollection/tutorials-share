## One-on-one support

For free, tailored, one-on-one help for your research project or GIS task, you can always make an appointment on the Harvard Map Collection's [website](https://library.harvard.edu/libraries/harvard-map-collection). Our librarians will work with you on the specifics of your project and deadlines to give you customized support at no cost. We specialize in a number of GIS software options, including ArcGIS, as well as open-source tools, and can help explain the differences, pros, and cons.

## ArcGIS Pro Tutorials

If you are looking specifically for help with ArcGIS Pro, the Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA) manages the Harvard University Key Licenses for this software, and maintains a robust set of tutorials, FAQs, MOOCs, and in-person workshops specifically geared towards ArcGIS Pro. To get started, check out the [CGA Frequently Asked Questions](https://gis.harvard.edu/faq), which includes many how-to style tutorials for ArcGIS.
