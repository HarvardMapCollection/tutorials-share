      <guid>https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/tutorials/openstreetmap/extractbyfeature/</guid>
      <description>In the previous OpenStreetMap (OSM) tutorial , we learned how to extract a standard set of map features from OpenStreetMap including waterways, buildings, general points of interest, and roads.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to specify by type of feature, and extract data within a particular extent for only that type of feature.
No programming is required for this tutorial; we will use only a QGIS plugin called QuickOSM.</description>

      <guid>https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/tutorials/qgis/change-crs/</guid>
      <description>Concepts &amp;ldquo;Map projections try to portray the surface of the earth, or a portion of the earth, on a flat piece of paper or computer screen. In layman’s term, map projections try to transform the earth from its spherical shape (3D) to a planar shape (2D).
A coordinate reference system (CRS) then defines how the two-dimensional, projected map in your GIS relates to real places on the earth. The decision of which map projection and CRS to use depends on the regional extent of the area you want to work in, on the analysis you want to do, and often on the availability of data.</description>

      <description>Example data We will be exploring tenure data, which looks at owner vs. renter-occupied units. We want census responses that have been aggregated to the census tract level. Our area of study is near the Harvard campus, in Somerville and Cambridge. We&amp;rsquo;ll be looking at the most recent estimates at the time this guide was written, 2015-2019. Geography tip: Census tracts are a popular aggregation unit, as they are more granular than county or state level data, but more available and statistically-reliable than block level data.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial, you will learn how to extract waterways, buildings, transport, places, and land use data from OpenStreetMap.
As a GIS user, you may encounter scenarios where data about a place&amp;rsquo;s built and natural environment is challenging to find.
Depending on the administrative resources of the place you are studying, GIS data may be more or less available for that place.
OpenStreetMap (OSM) can sometimes be a solution to that problem &amp;ndash; with some important caveats.</description>

      <guid>https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/tutorials/georeferencing/qgis/</guid>
      <description>Download QGIS , if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already.
Add a basemap Browser → XYZ Tiles → Open Street Map.
Set the project projection to WGS 84. At all times in the bottom right of the QGIS document, EPSG should read 4326.
Open Raster → Georeferencer.
The Georeferencing plugin comes automatically installed with recent versions of QGIS. If you do not see it, it is because it has not been enabled. To enable: navigate to Plugins → Manage &amp; Install Plugins → Installed and make sure the box next to Georeferencer GDAL is checked.</description>

      <guid>https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/tutorials/census-data-primer/perform-a-table-join/</guid>
      <description>Need help turning your spreadsheet data into a map? In this tutorial you will learn how to join tables to GIS shapefiles to create a new, mappable dataset with both geographic boundaries and statistical or attribute information.
Why do we join? Often, spreadsheets contain useful information we want to map. GIS software, however, does not know how to translate a spreadsheet without any inherent spatial information (such as point coordinates) into a visual map.</description>

      <guid>https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/tutorials/census-data-primer/clip-a-dataset/</guid>
      <description>Clipping is a way of cropping GIS data to a certain extent.
1
Why do we clip? Large datasets can be unwieldy and difficult to work with. You can create more effective visualizations if your data is focused. Tutorial data In this tutorial you will clip a shapefile of all census tracts in the United States to create a new shapefile of only census tracts in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For those who are following the census data tutorial series , we will be using the United States Census Tracts file we just created.</description>

      <description>Ensure your dataset is prepared in a way that permits you to make clear and responsible arguments when you are mapping. To cover your bases, read through this guide on statistical mapping best practices .
In this tutorial, we will cover one common data cleaning task &amp;ndash; that of &amp;ldquo;normalizing&amp;rdquo; data.
&amp;ldquo;To normalize, in a statistical sense, is to transform a set of measurements so that they may be compared in a meaningful way.</description>

      <description>Depending on whether you plan to make a static map, or there is some necessary interactive functionality required, the steps towards stying the map may be a bit different.
To create a rendered static map using QGIS, we recommend exploring the Points Unknown tutorials , each of which contains beginner-level tips for using QGIS to create maps with a nice design. You can skim these tutorials to glean recommended settings for using the Print Layout in QGIS.</description>
