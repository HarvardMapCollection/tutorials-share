      <description>Understand why georeferenced maps can be useful when asking and answering spatial questions Understand how to find georeferenced maps to use in a GIS project Find out how to take next steps in using information from paper maps in a GIS project In class activity What is georeferencing? Visit Atlascope.org , search for a place in Boston or Cambridge you are interested in exploring on a historical map, and get a sense of the value of georeferencing historical maps by toggling between different georeferenced map layers.</description>

      <description>Understand what OpenStreetMap (OSM) is, and how it can be helpful for finding data In class activity Visit OpenStreetMap.org , which we can think of as the Wikipedia of GIS. It is free, crowd-contributed geospatial data. Navigate to anywhere in the world you are interested in. Zoom super close in so that you can see individual features, such as buildings, roads, or bike lanes. Right-click a feature and select Query features.</description>
