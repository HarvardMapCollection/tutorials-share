      <title>— HUA Flight Reports</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/huige/hua-flight-reports/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/huige/hua-flight-reports/</guid>
      <description>The following information is extracted from the Flight Report cards of the first 3 years and change of the Aerial Photography classes (mostly Geography 36) given at HUIGE. This record covers 1933, 1934, 1935 and a few 1936 Flight Reports. These Flight Reports include approximate to detailed geographic data, as well as the photographers’ names. Although not all the aerial photographs stored at the CHSI are signed by students, and even though the student(s) signing the photos might be the ones who printed and assembled the photos rather than those who took them, the connection between the photographs at the CHSI and the Flight Reports below passes through the names of the students or instructors involved.</description>
