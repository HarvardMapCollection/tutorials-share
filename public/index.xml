      <description>We met Natalia Neira Nieto, a G1 in the Music Department&amp;rsquo;s Ethnomusicology program this summer when she was completing work for a library fellowship. Natalia&amp;rsquo;s work this summer was focused on wrangling geographic data about an important recording collection held in the Harvard Eda Kuhn Loeb Music Library.&#xA;Natalia&amp;rsquo;s project, in addition to exploring the subject matter related to her area of study, ethomusicology, uncovered many insights about the complexities and real-world impact that decision making within data projects can entail.</description>

      <description>Photo credit: Honora Spicer.&#xA;Story #1 A student needed help finding geospatial data and we made them a step-by-step tutorial. Here is the tutorial to obtain crowd-sourced OpenStreetMap data developed for the student. Story #2 A student was still developing the concept for their mapping project and used their initial Harvard Maps consult to brainstorm and sketch out ideas. Map sketch by HKS student Justine Baillart.&#xA;Story #3 Students make use of GIS resources beyond class projects.</description>

      <description>This guide will walk you through finding georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection and understanding the difference between raster and vector data.&#xA;Finding a historical map to use Depending on your project topic, it may be useful to be able to compare information from historic maps against the modern layers you are working with.&#xA;Many map library special collections allow you to download versions of their maps in formats that are already spatial data, and will be compatible with GIS mapping.</description>

      <description>Generating Geospatial Data from Historic Maps: A Step-by-Step Guide This project illustrates a core methodology supported by the Harvard Map Collection: transforming static historic maps into analyzable geospatial data. Through our partnership with Joyce Chaplin&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Re-Wilding Harvard&amp;#39; course, this initiative empowered students to investigate the evolving histories and changing natures of open space within Harvard&amp;#39;s campus and its surroundings, showcasing the library&amp;#39;s critical role in digital scholarship.&#xA;Hannah Adler &amp;#39;25, a student from the course, undertook an ambitious project focusing on the Charles River region of Harvard&amp;#39;s campus, particularly the area near Memorial Drive in Cambridge.</description>

      <description>Early one August morning, I found myself donning borrowed fishing waders on the banks of a restored tidal wetland in Northern California. Thanks to a Salata Institute grant, I spent a week studying the Sacramento San-Joaquin River Delta alongside biometeorology experts. After exploring maps of the region through my assistantship with the Harvard Map Collection, I was incredibly grateful for the opportunity to traverse the landscape on foot, and prepare for my senior thesis on the science of these special ecosystems.</description>

      <description>To start to explore how to access and use geospatial data, we will start with an example data scenario. The map below shows census tracts graded by social vulnerability index, layered against the locations of known toxics release facilities in Massachusetts.&#xA;Map layers displayed in desktop GIS program, QGIS.&#xA;The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is a dataset that garners census variables to identify and rank communities based on their vulnerability to environmental hazards or other emergencies.</description>

      <description>This dataset and story open the past of Harvard University’s Institute of Geographical Exploration (HUIGE, 1930-1951). The HUIGE was a building, a branch of Harvard’s defunct Geography department, a home to many students, and still a mystery to this day.&#xA;The scope of this project is simple: making a guide to as many repositories of HUIGE-related artifacts across Harvard’s campus and other institutions across Massachusetts. This guide cannot be complete but will hopefully help launch further inquiries into the fate of Aerial Photography and Geography at Harvard and in the USA.</description>

      <description>The following information is extracted from the Flight Report cards of the first 3 years and change of the Aerial Photography classes (mostly Geography 36) given at HUIGE. This record covers 1933, 1934, 1935 and a few 1936 Flight Reports. These Flight Reports include approximate to detailed geographic data, as well as the photographers’ names. Although not all the aerial photographs stored at the CHSI are signed by students, and even though the student(s) signing the photos might be the ones who printed and assembled the photos rather than those who took them, the connection between the photographs at the CHSI and the Flight Reports below passes through the names of the students or instructors involved.</description>

      <description>When I first arrived in Boston three years ago, only a few weeks away from starting college in the heart of Cambridge, I wanted to take in as much of the city as I could. Armed with a TripAdvisor list of &amp;ldquo;The 10 Best Things to Do in Boston&amp;rdquo; and a confusing MBTA map I found at the airport, I set off to the city&amp;rsquo;s tourists hotspots, historical landmarks, and buzzing restaurants.</description>

      <description>OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers a rich and dynamic source of geospatial data, often filling gaps where traditional datasets are unavailable. This guide explores two methods for extracting OSM data, allowing you to choose the approach that best suits your project&amp;#39;s requirements: a general extraction of common features, and a more specific extraction based on feature type.&#xA;Before diving into the extraction methods, it&amp;#39;s helpful to understand the nature of OpenStreetMap data. OSM is a collaborative, crowd-contributed project, akin to Wikipedia for maps.</description>
