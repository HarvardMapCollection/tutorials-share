The census series will equip you with all of the skills necessary to work with census data for digital mapping.

The United States census is a huge topic, and you may or may not have worked with census data before. 

Being able to navigate census data GIS files, and handle them in a way compatible with digital mapping is not intuitive, and this tutorial series is designed to set you up to be confident making census maps with GIS.

The tutorials are meant to be followed sequentially, though they can exist as standalones. Use the files you create from the previous tutorial in the next, or use the data download links in each lesson to stay caught up.

We can schedule additional workshop sessions on demand, as well as in-class workshops.
