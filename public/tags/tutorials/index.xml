      <description>On your own computer If you have a PC and a Harvard Key, you can download and install ArcGIS Pro on your own computer using these instructions from the Harvard Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA).&#xA;If you do not have a PC, you can:&#xA;Use the Harvard Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA) guide on How to install ArcGIS Desktop or Pro on a Mac . Consider using the open-source equivalent GIS desktop software, QGIS, which is OS-independent.</description>

      <description>Download QGIS , if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already.&#xA;Add a basemap Browser → XYZ Tiles → Open Street Map.&#xA;Set the project coordinate reference system to WGS 84. At all times in the bottom right of the QGIS document, EPSG should read 4326.&#xA;Optional context on coordinate reference systems Every dataset and every QGIS project each has a coordinate reference system (CRS). Coordinate reference systems allow the GIS software to know where on the world to place the dataset, how to line it up spatially.</description>

      <description>Do you want to be able to use a historic map for comparison in one of your ArcGIS Online projects, such as StoryMaps or ArcGIS Experience Builder ?&#xA;Georeferenced map from 1880 compared to a modern map in ArcGIS Online. There are a number of pathways or workflows for accomplishing this. Which one you pick will depend on a. the format your map data is in and b. the software environment you prefer to work in.</description>

      <description>In the previous OpenStreetMap (OSM) tutorial , we learned how to extract a standard set of map features from OpenStreetMap including waterways, buildings, general points of interest, and roads.&#xA;In this tutorial, we will learn how to specify by type of feature, and extract data within a particular extent for only that type of feature.&#xA;No programming is required for this tutorial; we will use only a QGIS plugin called QuickOSM.</description>

      <title>Change QGIS coordinate reference system</title>

      <description>Concepts &amp;ldquo;Map projections try to portray the surface of the earth, or a portion of the earth, on a flat piece of paper or computer screen. In layman’s term, map projections try to transform the earth from its spherical shape (3D) to a planar shape (2D).&#xA;A coordinate reference system (CRS) then defines how the two-dimensional, projected map in your GIS relates to real places on the earth. The decision of which map projection and CRS to use depends on the regional extent of the area you want to work in, on the analysis you want to do, and often on the availability of data.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial, you will learn how to extract waterways, buildings, transport, places, and land use data from OpenStreetMap.&#xA;As a GIS user, you may encounter scenarios where data about a place&amp;rsquo;s built and natural environment is challenging to find.&#xA;Depending on the administrative resources of the place you are studying, GIS data may be more or less available for that place.&#xA;OpenStreetMap (OSM) can sometimes be a solution to that problem &amp;ndash; with some important caveats.</description>

      <title>Perform a table join in QGIS</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/tutorials/census-data-primer/perform-a-table-join/</link>

      <description>Need help turning your spreadsheet data into a map? In this tutorial you will learn how to join tables to GIS shapefiles to create a new, mappable dataset with both geographic boundaries and statistical or attribute information.&#xA;Why do we join? Often, spreadsheets contain useful information we want to map. GIS software, however, does not know how to translate a spreadsheet without any inherent spatial information (such as point coordinates) into a visual map.</description>
