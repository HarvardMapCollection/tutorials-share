      <description>Objectives Understand how to use table joins to connect a spreadsheet of data to mapping data Practice thinking outside of the box with datasets 10 minutes to get started Imagine you are working on a project where you can find data for your project in spreadsheet format, but there are no shapes associated with the table. Maybe the data references towns, countries, or other units of geography. In this activity, we will explore how to evaluate a dataset&amp;rsquo;s GIS viability based on our ability to join it with spatial data.</description>
