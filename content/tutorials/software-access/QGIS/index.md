---

QGIS is a free and open-source desktop GIS software used to create, edit, visualize, analyze, and publish geospatial information on Windows, Mac, Linux, BSD and mobile devices.

### How to Download

1.  Visit [QGIS.org](https://qgis.org/en/site/).
2.  Select `Download Now`.
3.  Select your desired platform.

### Tips

*   If you have the option between many installer packages, choose `Standalone Long Term Release`.
*   To learn your way around the QGIS interface, you can check out these resources:
    *   [Understanding the QGIS Interface](https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org/guides/get-started-qgis/interface.html#menu-bar)
    *   [QGIS Documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/)

### Installation Troubleshooting on Mac

*   If you get an error message that Apple can't check the app for malicious software, instead of double-clicking the icon to open the program, instead try `right-clicking`, and select `Open`.
*   You should only have to do this the first time you open the software. This message is popping up because the app is not available through the app store; it is developed through the open-source GIS community.
