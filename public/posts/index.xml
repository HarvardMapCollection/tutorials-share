      <description>We met undergraduate Paige Lee while working with her general education class about how borders are constructed. In the class, students were asked to complete a project, choosing from a variety of format options, including making a map. The Harvard Map Collection supported students by advising on searching for data, using mapping software, and scoping out project ideas.
In this interview, we look at Paige’s custom-coded interactive mapping visualization, and learn more about her thought process and workflow.</description>

      <description>Join us Spring 2023 for weekly GIS office hours. We will meet in the Lamont media lab annex every Tuesday from 10am-12pm.
What to expect Chat about GIS tools and datasets Meet others using GIS in their work Share projects and get feedback What office hours are not You don’t need to have a specific question! Just an interest. Depending on how many people we have, you may still need to book a personal consultation for more in-depth advice.</description>

      <description>This project was made possible through a May Crane fellowship .
Mapping Cultural Difference The goal of this webpage is to allow others to follow the progress of this mapping project and understand the immediate and long-term goals and uses of the mapping project.
About this mapping project At its inception, this project&amp;rsquo;s main goal is to demonstrate cultural distance and difference as they pertain to staged representations of Latinx (or Latine) Americans living in the United States.</description>

      <description>Earlier this Fall, we visited with Carole Voulgaris&amp;rsquo;s Spatial Analysis class from the Graduate School of Design.
Example georeferencing assignment submitted by GSD student Ellie Shield.
The assignments in Spatial Analysis are tailored to introduce fundamental geospatial competencies, as well as center group collaboration, creativity, and iterative design.
THE VISIT In early September 2021, The Harvard Map Collection facilitated a class visit with Spatial Analysis, where we discussed shifts in cartographic theory, introduced the map collection, and foreshadowed the concept of georeferencing .</description>

      <description>Skills to create beautiful and engaging maps can be strengthened in a semester, says Bloomberg graphics journalist.
The type of narrative, map-based digital projects we see in the news, like the recent CityLab project documenting racist urban infrastructure in St. Paul, Minnesota require many research and technical skills to pull off.
The Harvard Map Collection asked Bloomberg graphics journalist, Rachael Dottle about her methodology in scoping, researching, and creating maps for this story.</description>
