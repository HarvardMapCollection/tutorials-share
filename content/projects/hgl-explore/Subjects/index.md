## My approach 

I wanted to condense this messy subjects list into more comprehensible buckets. This would allow potential users of HGL to understand the categories of information in the data portal in a more organized fashion. The approach I used was one of thematic clustering, I started by grouping the subjects that are closely related, intertwined and intermingled into bigger categories.

  Note for Dhruv: Here, in a few sentences put generally how the clustering tool works, how you picked the new subjects and where someone can find the scripts.
