## Example data 
- We will be exploring `tenure` data, which looks at owner vs. renter-occupied units.
- We want census responses that have been aggregated to the **census tract** level.
- Our area of study is near the Harvard campus, in Somerville and Cambridge. 
- We'll be looking at the most recent [estimates](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/estimates.html) at the time this guide was written, 2015-2019.

> **Geography tip:** Census tracts are a popular aggregation unit, as they are more granular than county or state level data, but more available and statistically-reliable than block level data. 

The steps in this tutorial series will work for any U.S. census data, such as age, race, income, etc. If you're not sure which variables are available, you can use [censusreporter.org](https://censusreporter.org/) to find out.

## Tips

- It takes a few minutes to prepare your extract. You can either wait and refresh the page, or you will receive an email when the data is ready.
- Extracts come with any accompanying codebook.
