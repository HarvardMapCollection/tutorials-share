      <description>Basemaps can be helpful reference points when working with spatial data.
How to add a basemap to your project Open a new QGIS project. In the left-hand browser menu, locate XYZ Tiles → OpenStreetMap
OpenStreetMap base tiles are built in to QGIS. Drag OpenStreetMap into the Map Canvas Zoom in to the desired location by selecting the Zoom In menu item, and clicking and dragging on the Map Canvas Tips To add other styles of basemap not included by default in the QGIS install, you can run a Google search about the latest QGIS plugins for basemaps.</description>

      <description>This tutorial will cover how to add tabular data to a QGIS project.
GIS software prefer tabular data to be in .csv format, rather than .xlsx. Before attempting to bring any spreadsheets into either QGIS or ArcGIS Pro, please be sure to save as .csv. Open QGIS .
In the main QGIS menu (banner across the top of the computer screen), select Layer → Add Layer → Add delimited text layer.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial you will learn how to adjust a layer&amp;rsquo;s opacity in QGIS so that you can &amp;ldquo;see underneath&amp;rdquo; or through the layer to the map data below.
In the QGIS layer list, right-click the layer you would like to adjust the opacity for.
Select Properties.
In the properties menu, select Legend. Move Opacity slider from Available widgets to Used widgets by selecting Opacity slider and clicking the right-hand arrow Add selected widgets.</description>

      <description>Concepts &amp;ldquo;Map projections try to portray the surface of the earth, or a portion of the earth, on a flat piece of paper or computer screen. In layman’s term, map projections try to transform the earth from its spherical shape (3D) to a planar shape (2D).
A coordinate reference system (CRS) then defines how the two-dimensional, projected map in your GIS relates to real places on the earth. The decision of which map projection and CRS to use depends on the regional extent of the area you want to work in, on the analysis you want to do, and often on the availability of data.</description>
