Desktop GIS software is helpful when trying to make sense of census data. We will use free, open-source QGIS.

# How to Download QGIS

QGIS is a free and open source desktop GIS software used to create, edit, visualize, analyze, and publish geospatial information on Windows, Mac, Linux, BSD and mobile devices.

## How to Download

1. Visit [QGIS.org](https://qgis.org/en/site/).

2. Select `Download Now`.

3. Select your desired platform.

## Tips

- If you have the option between many installer packages, choose `Standalone Long Term Release`
- To learn your way around the QGIS interface, you can check out these resources:
    - [Understanding the QGIS Interface](https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org/guides/get-started-qgis/interface.html#menu-bar)
    - [QGIS Documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/)


## Warning

![QGIS can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software error](media/apple-malicious-software.png)

- If you get an error message that Apple can't check the app for malicious software, instead of double-clicking the icon to open the program, instead try `right-clicking`, and select `Open`.

- You should only have to do this the first time you open the software. This message is popping up because the app is not available through the app store; it is developed through the open source GIS community.
