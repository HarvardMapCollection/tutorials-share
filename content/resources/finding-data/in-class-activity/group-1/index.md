## Objectives
- Explore open data portals and learn how to use them to find GIS data
- Explore how content may be organized and how to refine searching


## 10 minutes to get started

Consider this request a student made to the Harvard Map Collection for help with finding GIS data in 2024:

> "I would like to create a GIS map of food deserts in DC by layering maps of grocery store locations, corner store locations, and other options found on Open Data DC with census data to identify areas where large populations do not have access to healthy foods."

Where is a good place to **get started** searching for food desert data in DC?

> 1. In a web browser, search for "GIS open data portal DC".

> 2. Visit `opendata.dc.gov`.

![Homepage with search bar](search.png)

> 3. Scroll down and find the search bar that says "Search for apps, maps, documents, data and stories...". Place your cursor in the search bar and click `Enter`. This will bring you to a results page with all items, and filters you can use to refine your search.

> 4. Under `Type` select `Feature Service`. It is a trend that many open data portals host GIS data layers as streaming "feature services", which are displayed in web maps. From these feature service landing pages, you can often download the data in various common geospatial formats, such as `shapefile` or `geoJSON`. Using `type` facets and filtering data by `shapefile`, `geojsons`, `point, line, or polygon` or `feature service` are a good way to tell the search portal you are looking for **geospatial data**, as opposed to spreadsheets, PDFs, or other kinds of information. 

> 5. Click a random result, and observe how the feature service landing page is structured. What are your observations? How would you download this data, in order to bring it into a GIS?

> 6. Return to the results list, filtered by `Feature Service`. Search for relevant terms `food`, `grocery`, `corner stores`, and observe which datasets are available which could be useful to the project. 

## Follow-up resources (next steps)

If you have additional time, or would like to explore data portals in more detail, you can get started with these resources:

- [Open Data: Introduction, New York Institute of Technology Library](https://libguides.nyit.edu/opendata)
- [Open Data, Brown University Library](https://libguides.brown.edu/opendata)
- [Geographic Informmation Systems (GIS): Geospatial Data, Brown University Library](https://libguides.brown.edu/gis/data)



## Discussion questions
1. What did you learn about searching in open data portals that you think would be valuable to share with your group?
2. Prepare to present any demos which could help communicate these takeaways
3. Did you find anything surprising or interesting in the follow-up resources?
