## About

This site is an effort of the Harvard Map Collection to make our teaching and research materials more discoverable.

There are many people at Harvard teaching GIS or using GIS in their research. If this is you, we would like to be more connected!

Are you already using GIS @ Harvard? Would you like to start?

## How to connect

Email us at **maps@harvard.edu.**

Stop by our GIS Office Hours every Tuesday at 10 am (Spring 2023). We meet in Lamont 310, chat about GIS, and problem solve.
