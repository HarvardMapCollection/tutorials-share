Earlier this Fall, we visited with Carole Voulgaris's Spatial Analysis class from the Graduate School of Design.

The assignments in **Spatial Analysis** are tailored to introduce fundamental geospatial competencies, as well as center group collaboration, creativity, and iterative design. 

## THE VISIT

In early September 2021, The Harvard Map Collection facilitated a class visit with **Spatial Analysis**, where we discussed shifts in cartographic theory, introduced the map collection, and foreshadowed the concept of [georeferencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georeferencing). Following the session, we worked with independent groups of students who were tasked with picking a map from our collections, georeferencing it, and combining that newly spatialized image with other datasets to produce three digitally rendered maps.


When visiting the map collection in groups, for many, it was the first time meeting other group members. Students started leveraging their shared interests to try to think of project topics that could highlight broader issues. During the course of these conversations, aided by library staff, students evaluated potential topics against the availability of source material, including both historic maps and supplementary geospatial data.

During this assignment, students practiced:
* Working collaboratively
* Some fundamentals of creating compelling data maps, including:
    * Georeferencing
    * Working with different spatial file types
    * Layering multiple datasets
* Finding and working with primary source materials, including:
    * Archival collections
    * Digital geospatial data


## The project

One map that caught our eye was created by Aeshna Prasad, Michael Lidwin, Megan Mcglinchey, and Mehvish Jamal. They were determined to stitch together eight disparate sheets from an 18th century map of Venice.

The group was interested in exploring the theme of climate change and sea level rise through the lens of flooding in Venice. 

They picked digital datasets that could help visually explore this topic: historic boundaries, neighborhood districts, flooding areas, and buildings which could be affected.

### Map 1: boundaries

### Map 3: at-risk structures
