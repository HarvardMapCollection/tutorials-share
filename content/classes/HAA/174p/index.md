## Prof. Jordan recommended datasets

- [Castles and Forts in Ghana](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=c4d76bd7dd084ad18bb4d156d4227a0c)
> Mapping the historical European castles and forts built along the coast of West Africa shows the density of occupation of European control and manipulation of trade on the African continent. The castles and fortresses were eventually used to hold captured Africans for chattel slavery and sent abroad.
- [Favellas in Brazil](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/markfinn1/dataset-de-favelas-em-so-paulo)
> Favelas or slums are generally located on the edge of urban populations. The largest demographic population in favelas is the Brazilian Black community. Favelas are substandard makeshift housing with low-income populations and are stigmatized by crime, low environmental standards, and heavy policing. Mapping Favelas will help expose toxic environmental locations and resources lacking in the area. It will also allow students to understand their eventual research on the demographics of where Brazilians live compared to the Favelas.
- [Prison population across the U.S.](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=512c206867d2438ebd4ea40cce370617)
> The prison systems in the U.S. and Brazil are heavily populated, with a high per capita rate of the African Diaspora community. Mapping the prisons will highlight critical states with the highest imprisonment population. The student can then pinpoint policies and criminal activity related to race relations.
