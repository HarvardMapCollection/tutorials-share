      <title>Extract OpenStreetMap features</title>

      <description>In the previous OpenStreetMap (OSM) tutorial , we learned how to extract a standard set of map features from OpenStreetMap including waterways, buildings, general points of interest, and roads.
In this tutorial, we will learn how to specify by type of feature, and extract data within a particular extent for only that type of feature.
No programming is required for this tutorial; we will use only a QGIS plugin called QuickOSM.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial, you will learn how to extract waterways, buildings, transport, places, and land use data from OpenStreetMap.
As a GIS user, you may encounter scenarios where data about a place&amp;rsquo;s built and natural environment is challenging to find.
Depending on the administrative resources of the place you are studying, GIS data may be more or less available for that place.
OpenStreetMap (OSM) can sometimes be a solution to that problem &amp;ndash; with some important caveats.</description>
