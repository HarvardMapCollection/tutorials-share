Join us Spring 2023 for weekly GIS office hours. We will meet in the Lamont media lab annex every Tuesday from 10am-12pm.

## What to expect

- Chat about GIS tools and datasets
- Meet others using GIS in their work
- Share projects and get feedback

## What office hours are not

- You don‚Äôt need to have a specific question! Just an interest.
- Depending on how many people we have, you may still need to <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/HarvardMapCollection1@HU.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/" target="_blank">book a personal consultation</a> for more in-depth advice.

## Are we on this week?

There may be some weeks where we don't meet. The <a href="https://libcal.library.harvard.edu/calendar/main?t=d&q=gis%20office%20hours&cid=15049&cal=15049&inc=0" target="_blank">library calendar</a>  reflects the most current schedule. 

## Don't get lost! üó∫Ô∏è

You can get to the **media lab annex** by going to the 3rd floor of Lamont, and walking _through_ the Farnsworth room.
