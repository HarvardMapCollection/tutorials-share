      <description>Get here quick: https://bit.ly/find-gis-data&#xA;Harvard Map Collection Map Collection website .&#xA;Scope üö® This is not a workshop on how to use GIS mapping software. Please consider referring to our other in-person learning opportunities or follow-along materials from previous events. üö® Today will focus on how to find relevant source data for a GIS project. Goals Understand why you might use GIS data for your mapping project. Get a feel for the flow and pace of what it&amp;rsquo;s like to work with GIS data.</description>

      <description>Objectives Explore open data portals and learn how to use them to find GIS data Explore how content may be organized and how to refine searching 10 minutes to get started Consider this request a student made to the Harvard Map Collection for help with finding GIS data in 2024:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I would like to create a GIS map of food deserts in DC by layering maps of grocery store locations, corner store locations, and other options found on Open Data DC with census data to identify areas where large populations do not have access to healthy foods.</description>

      <description>Objectives Understand how to use table joins to connect a spreadsheet of data to mapping data Practice thinking outside of the box with datasets 10 minutes to get started Imagine you are working on a project where you can find data for your project in spreadsheet format, but there are no shapes associated with the table. Maybe the data references towns, countries, or other units of geography. In this activity, we will explore how to evaluate a dataset&amp;rsquo;s GIS viability based on our ability to join it with spatial data.</description>
