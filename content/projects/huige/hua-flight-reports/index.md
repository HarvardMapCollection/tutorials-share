The following information is extracted from the Flight Report cards of the first 3 years and change of the Aerial Photography classes (mostly Geography 36) given at HUIGE. This record covers 1933, 1934, 1935 and a few 1936 Flight Reports. These Flight Reports include approximate to detailed geographic data, as well as the photographers’ names. Although not all the aerial photographs stored at the CHSI are signed by students, and even though the student(s) signing the photos might be the ones who printed and assembled the photos rather than those who took them, the connection between the photographs at the CHSI and the Flight Reports below passes through the names of the students or instructors involved. The ultimate goal is to one day geo-reference all existing HUIGE photographs in order to learn more about the span of the geographical record the HUIGE's affiliates created. Simultaneously, the record which can be created by transferring the geographical data into graphic form is also instructive. For an example see the map “Student Flights 1935 – HUIGE” contained in the [main article](https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/posts/nicolae/). Such flight reports are available for every school year until the year 1939-1940 and then again for the year 1949-1950. Activities during the War may have been of a different nature, notably through the ESMDC (Engineering, Science and Management Defense Courses) courses offered at the HUIGE in 1941 and 1942. I hope to systematize all Flight Report data in the future.
