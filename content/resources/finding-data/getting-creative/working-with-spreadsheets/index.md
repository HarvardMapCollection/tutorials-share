So you have a spreadsheet?

## Importing coordinates 
- Spreadsheets with coordinates can be imported to GIS software as points
- While this page is under construction, check out our [importing coordinates from a table](https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/tutorials/qgis/add-spreadsheet/). 


## Geocoding addresses to get coordinates
- Spreadsheets with addresses can be geocoded to create coordinates, which you can then import to GIS software as points
- While this page is under construction, check out this [library guide on geocoding](https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/DS/Resources/QGIS). 

## No coordinates but names of places? Try a table join
- If you have a table where every record or observation notates a corresponding location, for example, town name, or country code, you can *join* that table to a *shapefile* with corresponding locations.
- While this page is under construction, check out our [guide on table joins](https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/tutorials/census-data-primer/perform-a-table-join/).
