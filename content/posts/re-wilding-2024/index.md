There's edenic ideals of what life used to be like pre-settlement. 
There's the reality of what we have now.
The concept is trying to actualize our legitimate needs for more symbiotic relationships with nature in ways that are doable in the current built & natural environment.
For successful Re-wilding projects, it's useful to study 1. what are our modern needs 2. What is the current existing environment
Procedurally -- finding discrepencies and surprises between edenic ideals and what really exists is useful in starting to brainstorm ways for achieving symbiosis in future open space
Example: the *idea* that Harvard Yard footpaths are organically occurring vs. studying the history of deliberate landscaping & manicuring.
Looking at pictures
Things that surprise us are good clues
Teaches us about historical ideals 
Helps us understand the relationship between our own ideals and the workable landscape
GIS **one useful tool** for comparing past and present
There's no one schema to fit it to or theory that explains it all
Coming at it from lots of different perspectives using different datasets can help explore the topic more

Three student group in-depth studies & why GIS was useful & libraries supportive
