The Harvard Map Collection collects and preserves GIS data for long-term discovery and reuse in the [Harvard Geospatial Library (HGL)](https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/harvard-geospatial-library). You might like to extend the long-term value of your research by making your data available in a tool like HGL or [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/), or perhaps you'd like some feedback on how you are communicating the GIS components of your project. Maybe this is the first time you are thinking about this topics, and it sounds intriguing to you. No matter where you are in this process, we are here to help.

## Metadata?

You may already have a system for citing the GIS layers you're finding or making. Or maybe it's the very beginning of your project and you want some tips. Ultimately, the usability of your data comes down to the documentation or metadata you're creating. 

GIS metadata is not super intuitive, so this guide is meant to help with that.

## On this page, you will find:
- A [list of prompts](https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/resources/researchers-handbook/prompts/) for creating your own GIS metadata
- A <a href="media/FGDC-Metadata-Template.xlsx" download="FGDC-Metadata-Template.xlsx">template</a> for doing so
- Descriptions of the [consultation services](#guided-interview) available through the library

## 3 steps to discovery

It can be helpful to think of packaging up your GIS data in 3 steps.

### Research project

In the research project stage, you are immersed in the work of your project. You are working to capture and encode your data. You are managing many different aspects of the project.


### Metadata

When you are creating metadata, instead of broadly envisioning your project, you are now having to switch to a hyperfocused stage of work that can feel rote, technical, and tedious. 

Oscillating between actually working on the project, and carving out time to work on this highly technical, but important metadata is a serious challenge for researchers. This is why we offer our guided interview consultation services.

### Guided interview

One of the services we offer at the Map Collection is a guided interview meant to intermediate between where you are with your project, and where you'd like to be with your data. If you were to deposit your data today, the way we would enter it into our [data portal](https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/harvard-geospatial-library), is by creating highly structured metadata using extensible markup language (XML) and a federally-specified standard of description, by the [Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)](https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata). 

Describing data this way allows portals like the Harvard Geospatial Library to function, and provides useful contextual information for researchers trying to understand details about the datasets they find in online discovery portals. The problem is that these standards are incredibly specific and time consuming, and do require specialist knowledge to populate. 

Our guided interviews are meant to liaise between the vast knowledge you have about your project, and the technical, specific ways to capture it so that many people can benefit from and continue building upon your work.

| Action item | What's in it for the library | What's in it for the researcher |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Partner with the library to package and describe your GIS data using methods aligned with open access best practices | Able to provide better access to data materials because they are well-described and discoverable; Fulfill objectives of supporting GIS needs of researchers | Extend the value of your work by making your methods reproducible; facilitate transparency; Ensure you (and not the publisher) are retaining rights to your data |



## Suggested next steps

1. Even though we don't recommend trying to fill out the <a href="media/FGDC-Metadata-Template.xlsx" download="FGDC-Metadata-Template.xlsx">FGDC template</a>  on your own, it can be useful to know which fields we typically capture, so that while you're working you can document any important information. 

2. [Schedule an interview with us](https://library.harvard.edu/libraries/harvard-map-collection). We will walk through prompts designed to generate high-quality metadata. Even if your goal is not to deposit datasets, it can be helpful to get feedback about how you are thinking about and communicating your data work. You can also use [the prompts](https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/resources/researchers-handbook/prompts/) on your own.
