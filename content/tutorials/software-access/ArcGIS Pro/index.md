ArcGIS Pro is a powerful, proprietary desktop GIS software developed by Esri. It is widely used in various industries and academic disciplines for advanced spatial analysis, mapping, and data management. 

The Harvard Map Collection develops in-depth tutorials primarily for **QGIS, a separate, free, and open-source GIS software.** We prioritize QGIS due to its compatibility with reproducible academic workflows and the long-term preservation of spatial research data. Rest assured, we support your spatial analysis and methodological questions, no matter which GIS software you choose, and we can even help you decide.

### Access ArcGIS Pro On Your Own Computer

If you have a PC and a Harvard Key, you can download and install ArcGIS Pro directly on your computer. Follow the [instructions](https://gis.harvard.edu/arcgis-pro) provided by the Harvard Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA).

If you do not have a PC, consider these alternatives:

1.  Consult the Harvard Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA) guide on [How to install ArcGIS Desktop or Pro on a Mac](https://gis.harvard.edu/faq/how-installing-arcgis-desktop-or-pro-mac-computer).
2.  Explore QGIS, an open-source GIS desktop software that is OS-independent. You can find [QGIS download and installation instructions here](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=1477394&p=11028732).Â 

### Use ArcGIS Pro at the Library

#### Lamont Media Lab

The Lamont Media Lab is located in the basement of [Lamont Library](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Hzb4UFgFNbetQ3xa6).

The following two general PCs have ArcGIS Pro:

-   HCL-PUB1
-   HCL-PUB2

#### Widener Atkins Reading Room

The Widener Atkins Reading Room is on the second floor of [Widener Library](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZzNYNeJBnUhBq3Nk7).

PCs with ArcGIS Pro are available here.

#### Cabot Science Library

Located in the Science Center, all public Windows machines in [Cabot Library](http://maps.app.goo.gl/ZotpFXbxFDd97dHS6) have ArcGIS Pro available. There is one specialty PC with extra computing power available on the lower level.

#### Graduate School of Design (GSD) Frances Loeb Library

Many PCs with ArcGIS Pro are available in the basement of the [Frances Loeb Library](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nFRGGMQ52JEk3um67) for the Graduate School of Design (GSD).

The Digital Research Studio Space, also in the GSD library basement, features a machine with increased computing power that also runs ArcGIS Pro.

For questions about these spaces, contact the Graduate School of Design GIS librarian, [Bruce Boucek](https://library.harvard.edu/staff/bruce-boucek).

#### Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) Library
##### All Harvard Affiliates

All Harvard affiliates can use ArcGIS Pro on the 5 PCs in the [HKS Library](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fNmrJm3iwc14wLVJ7), located on the ground floor of the Littauer Building on the HKS campus.

##### Harvard Kennedy School Students

HKS students with a HUID can borrow 3-hour loaner laptops from the HKS Library Services Desk. These loaner laptops include ArcGIS Pro.

### Access ArcGIS From Institute for Quantitative Social Science Lab

The Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS) has a [computer lab](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/computer-labs) in the [CGIS Knafel building (concourse level)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SaiKxpSP8FrexV3x7). Each computer has ArcGIS Pro and other specialized software and computing services.

First-time IQSS lab users must [fill out a form](https://harvard.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2ivxTdteFPmzfwi?Q_CHL=qr) for manual approval before accessing lab computers. Please account for processing time before your visit.

### Access ArcGIS from a HUIT laptop
#### Request a Laptop

HUIT loans laptops for up to two weeks. Initiate this process by [filling out this form](https://harvard.service-now.com/ithelp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=fc5cab849710ad509af6d804a253af0a) or by visiting the HUIT help desk in the [Science Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZotpFXbxFDd97dHS6).

#### Download ArcGIS Pro

HUIT loaner PCs are provided with admin privileges. You can then access ArcGIS Pro by following the Harvard Center for Geographic Analysis [ArcGIS Pro for Harvard Key holders](https://gis.harvard.edu/arcgis-pro) download instructions.

### Access ArcGIS from House Commuter Labs

View a [list of available computers](https://harvard.service-now.com/ithelp?id=kb_article&sys_id=dc44f1ea93ad82104cf93f9a7bba10e5) in the houses.

### ArcGIS Pro Tutorials & Support

Developing strong core GIS methods is more important than mastering a single software, ensuring your skills remain valuable as programs evolve. While most tasks in ArcGIS Pro can also be accomplished in QGIS, you might choose ArcGIS Pro for the following reasons:

-   Many industries utilize ArcGIS Pro or the ESRI suite, which could enhance your competitiveness in your field.
-   Your course might specifically teach GIS methodologies using ArcGIS Pro.
-   You may have prior experience with ArcGIS Pro and prefer working within that environment.

For ArcGIS Pro tutorials, the Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA) manages Harvard University Key Licenses and maintains extensive tutorials, FAQs, MOOCs, and in-person workshops. Begin by checking the [CGA Frequently Asked Questions](https://gis.harvard.edu/faq) for numerous how-to tutorials.

### GIS Technical Support from the Harvard Map Collection

The Harvard Map Collection, located in the basement of [Pusey Library](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gBQgTUvYNfTuGAG76), offers free, customized GIS instructional consultations regardless of your chosen software.

Our librarians provide advice on various software, project specifics, and sources for GIS data. Visit the [Harvard Map Collection website](https://library.harvard.edu/libraries/harvard-map-collection) to request an appointment.
