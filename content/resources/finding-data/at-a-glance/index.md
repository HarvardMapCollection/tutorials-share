*We are actively developing this guidebook. It will be available September 2024.*

>## Introduction
>- This guidebook was developed by a cohort of GIS librarians from different universities
>- The materials are meant to be a companion to bolster your facility searching for GIS data
>- Use the guide as a checklist to help decide where you'd like support from librarians
>
>## Guide structure
>This guidebook is organized into three sections:
>1. Optimizing your search
>2. Getting creative
>3. Maximizing your research consultation
>
>The rest of this page will give you a skimmable outline and list quick tips for what is expanded on in the rest of the sections. Find other pages that go into each theme with deeper explanation and example problems and datasets.
>
>## In-person workshops
>This content is sometimes offered synchronously in workshop format. To check upcoming dates, check the [Harvard Library calendar](https://libcal.library.harvard.edu/calendar/main?t=d&q=gis&cid=15049&cal=15049&inc=0). If you teach a course, and would like us to teach these materials to your class, please contact the authors.

## Optimizing your search

### Search tips
- `"site:.gov"`
- Or specifically search the site, instead of domain, e.g. `"site:usda.gov"`
- `"open data"`
- `"shapefile"`
- `"download"`
- Thought exercise: who cares about this data?


### Portals
- [State clearinghouses](https://pitt.libguides.com/c.php?g=12667&p=2206252)
- Try other geographies, municipal, county


### Spatial resolution 
- Starting small + scaling up
- If you scale up, you can filter or geographically clip after

### Temporal resolution 
- Realistic expections -- some useful data isn't updated often


### Use visualization tools to point back to source
- PolicyMap (including [blog](https://www.policymap.com/resources/blog)), SocialExplorer ([blog](https://www.socialexplorer.com/blog/post)), ArcGIS Online


>## Getting creative
> ### Augmenting data
> - Importing coordinates, geocoding, or join
> ### Creating data
> - Georeffing
> - Making spreadsheet with coordinates
> - Creating vector data with Google MyMaps, geojson.io, or desktop software (QGIS, ArcGIS Pro)
> ### Crowdsourcing 
> #### OSM
> - Specific feature types with tags (e.g. restaurants)
> - "Basemap" style (e.g. roads, buildings)
> #### Natural Earth
> - 
> #### Wiki
> - Political geographies / maps to georeference
> - Difficult to find coordinate data 
> - Links to datasets in sources 
> ##### GeoNames
> -
